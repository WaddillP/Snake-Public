# Snake-Public

The code utilizes JFrame, JPanel and ActionListener in order to create a playable version of the popular snake game. In which the user controls the head of a snake that goes around and collects apples by running into said apples with its head. All the while the user has to be careful to not run the snake into itself or the outer walls.

Current Features:

A Snake that is controllable with the arrow keys.

The snake grows one square longer with every apple eaten.

The ability to customize the amount of apples in play.

The ability to customize if you would like your snake to be rainbow in color.

A running score total.

A Game Over Screen.

Things to Still Implement:

Custom Sprites for Apple, Snake Head and body

Moving the customization of Snake Color and Number of Apples into the game rather than before the game is launched.

A Custom Background.

Code is available upon request.
